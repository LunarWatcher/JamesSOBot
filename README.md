# SO-ChatBot
# Description

I could not find a simple and easy to understand StackExchange chat bot API so I decided to create my own. This can be easily used to create your own bot, simply remove the plugins and add your own!

I am also planning on writing full documentation for the how SO Chat works, as none currently exists. 

# Usage
```
|| command args
